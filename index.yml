  Human Gut Microbiome contains collection of diverse species which help carry
  out various functions for the proper functioning of the human body. However, IBD
  is a condition where the diversity of this microbiome is significantly altered.
  Little is known about the causes and effects of these variations in the present
  literature. The next generation sequencing techniques provide suitable data for
  Metagenomic analysis leading to identification of uncluttered microorganisms, and
  make it possible to get detailed functional insights into the functional footprint
  of these altered microorganisms. This study uses of KEGG pathways for mapping functionality
  of the diverse gene sets in order to better understand function level changes caused
  due to the altered microbiome in case of IBD.
