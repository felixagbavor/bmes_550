title: Ppulmonary Fibrosis CT Image augmentation
author: Felix Agbavor, Matthew Falcione, Victor Flamini
abstract: With the recent advances in computational image processing,
rapid imaging-based diagnosis is possible. Diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis,
which have traditionally been identified by clinicians examining numerous
patient CT scans, can now be aided by computer analysis to reach a diagnosis
more rapidly and accurately. The project implemented a PHP, HTML, and CSS web front-end
for potential users to upload files and retrieve previously processed images.
The imaging script, written in python, can also be extended in later interactions
with predictive models that forecast lung function decline. The processed image paths
along with the upload date and time and the corresponding user are stored in a SQLite
database for comparing disease progression in patients across multiple scans.
